Every human being has a highly specific mixture of antibody specificities in the blood, which reflecting the individual history of interactions with body-foreign substances like virulence factors of pathogens.

The determination of antigen-specific antibody content is a central quantitative measure for diagnostics and vaccine development. The \textbf{xMAPr app} was designed to analyze xMAP® technology derived serological assay data measured in serial dilutions (hyper-dynamic-range {[}HDR{]} data).

xMAPr was developed under GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE Version 3.

\chapter{Introduction}\label{introduction}}

Measuring the antibody response to multiple antigens in biofluids can be achieved using the xMAP® technology supplied by Luminex®. For the multiplexing assay all antigens are covalently bound to small paramagnetic particles (MagPlex™) of unique fluorescence dye combination making it possible to distinguish between the mixed spheres in the full assay.

The immune response to some antigens can be extremely strong and extremely weak to others. Thus, the quantitative dynamic range of analysis extends over several orders of magnitude. In a standard measurement, the patient's plasma/serum is diluted 1000-fold and / or 10000-fold. Since this commonly used approach carries the risk of generating quantitative data close to the detection limit when including multiple antigens with a wide variance in the expected antibody responses. This results in error prone data sets making the interpretation of the data very difficult. An advanced approach has been developed to overcome this issue including a serial dilution based measurement of samples granting results derived from the linear range of each antigen.

The resulting complex data set could not be analyzed to date. Therefore, an iterative analysis procedure was developed and implemented using the programming language R and the shiny framework resulting the the \textbf{xMAPr app}.

xMAPr was developed to analyze and visualize data from bead-based experiments performed with the xMAP® technology. The whole basis of the the analysis is the utilization of serial dilutions per sample to avoid saturation effects. Figure \ref{fig:xMAPrWorkflow} illustrates the mode of operation of xMAPr.

\hypertarget{xponent-raw-data-processing}{%
\subsection{xPONENT® raw data processing}\label{xponent-raw-data-processing}}

For the analysis several files are mandatory. After you performed the serological assay including a coupling control the resulting csv-files can be exported using the xPONENT® software from Luminex® (Figure \ref{fig:xPonentCSVexport}). The resulting files can be imported into xMAPr, which will automatically genrate the correct input files for the analysis.

\begin{figure}

{\centering \includegraphics[width=17.81in]{figures/xPonent_export} 

}

\caption{xPonent csv-file export}\label{fig:xPonentCSVexport}
\end{figure}

\href{figures/xMAPr_analysis_workflow.png}{inspect xPonent csv-file export}

The gerated raw input files can be inspected and manipulated after prepartion since they are stored as easily accessible txt-files in case of naming errors or removale of specific samples for the later analysis (e.g.~included standard wells to monitor the inter-plate reproduceability).

If multiple csv-files should be used for the generation of the xMAPr input files, make sure to store them all in one folder for the upload selection. When all necessary files are selected start processing the data by clicking on the ``Run data processing''-button. When processing is done you can download the raw txt-files as a zip-folder by clicking on the green download button.

\end{figure}

In the first instance of the pipeline, the data are corrected for their measurement background, bead count and normalized to their respective coupling efficiency. This is followed by the process of sequential multiple regression. Here, a saturation curve regression model is first assumed and calculated by means of ``non-least squared''. If such a calculation is not possible, a linear regression is assumed. If this calculation is successful, even a 50-fold dilution of the patient sample is still in the linear range and the respective antigen thus shows a very low immune response. In order to obtain individual quantitative values per patient and antigen, the different individual regression curves had to be converted into a meaningful value, whereby the antibody titer, which is represented over the individual dilution stages, represents the most important quantitative quantity. Here, in the saturation curve model, the half-maximal intensity was multiplied by the reciprocal dilution at the half-maximal intensity \texttt{(e.g.,\ half\ maximal\ norm.\ MFI\ intensity\ =\ 50\ \ \&\ dilution\ at\ half\ maximalnorm.\ MFI\ intensity\ \ =\ 0.001\ -\/-\textgreater{}\ 50\ *\ (1\ /\ 0.001)\ =\ immune\ response\ of\ 50,000)}. Linear regression multiplies the first serial dilution step by the intensity at that step. This results in a very small quantitative value.

xMAPr will perform multiple regression modeling on the data of each sample/antigen combination and subsequently decide which fit type is most characteristic for the sample/antigen specific data (decision tree figure \ref{fig:xMAPrDecTree})

\hypertarget{decision-tree}{%
\subsubsection{Decision tree}\label{decision-tree}}

The decision tree was build to elucidate the best fit for the data.

\hypertarget{unspecifc-binding-issue-ubi-fit}{%

Two new parameters have been introduced since version 2.0.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  method for data processing (selection of fit processing: default is hook binding detection)
\item
  ubi response ratio cutoff (cutoff for leave out saturation curve fit (to min. of 5 dilution stages) response calculation ratio (all data piont fit / leave out fit) for resolving unspecific binding issues)
\end{itemize}

The \textbf{hook} method is the standard approach (\emph{default}) where a saturation fit is executed using all data points, both with and without the application of the hook effect detection algorithm.

The \textbf{hook+ubi} method carries out a fit utilizing all data points. If this is successful, it iteratively excludes (from the lowest dilution stage) from one to the entire range of dilutions until only 5 valid data points remain (for each step a saturation curve fit is carried out). If the calculated response from the saturation fit with all data points is similar to the response without dilutions, the fit with all data points is used for categorization in the non-linear least squares (nls) fit decision tree. However, if the response exceeds the \emph{ubi response ratio cutoff}, the fit excluding the dilution is considered.
If the fit with all data points did not succeed but the ones without some dilution the first best fit is used for the nls fit.

\hypertarget{example-for-hookubi}{%
\subparagraph{\texorpdfstring{Example for \textbf{hook+ubi}}{Example for hook+ubi}}\label{example-for-hookubi}}

example 1

Lets say you have measured 8 dilutions from one sample (50fold, 100fold, 500fold, 5000fold, 10000fold, \ldots)

\begin{longtable}[]{@{}lll@{}}
\toprule\noalign{}

without 50-100fold dil. & 20000 & 2 \\
without 50-500fold dil. & 22000 & 1.1 \\
\end{longtable}

In this example only 3 left out fits can be performed until 5 valid data points are left.
If the \emph{ubi response ratio cutoff} would be \textbf{2} the fit without \textbf{50-500fold dil.} would be takes as nls fit.
If the \emph{ubi response ratio cutoff} would be \textbf{4} (default) the fit without \textbf{without 50fold dil.} would be takes as nls fit.

\end{longtable}

In this example; if the \emph{ubi response ratio cutoff} would be \textbf{2} the fit without \textbf{all data points} would be takes as nls fit.

\hypertarget{global-analysis-inspection-screenshots}{%
\subsubsection{global analysis inspection (Screenshots)}\label{global-analysis-inspection-screenshots}}

\begin{figure}

{\centering \includegraphics[width=50.5in]{figures/global_result_overview}

\caption{xMAPr anaylsis output data inspection >> global overview}\label{fig:globalResultOverview}
\end{figure}

\href{figures/global_result_overview.png}{inspect xMAPr anaylsis output data inspection \textgreater\textgreater{} global overview}

The \texttt{overview\ of\ responses} (figure \ref{fig:globalResultOverview}) tab depicts the used fit count histogram (figure \ref{fig:globalResultOverview} \textbf{left plot}), which should have a majority of \emph{nls} (non-least squared) fits (saturation curve fits).

A \emph{nls\_with\_exclusion} fit - is a nls fit that appears to posses a signal drop in the first sample dilutions in the measured curve. This happens if the secondary antibody \textbf{did not saturate the bound sample antibodies on the bead}. Therefore the automatic detection of a signal drops in the dilution response curve will flagged and not use the responsible data points for the fit (\emph{nls\_wih\_exclusion}).

If linear fits were used for the majority of curve fittings the used serial dilution range did not end up in a saturation making a saturation curve fit impossible. The resulting response data should be used carefully ! In that case a one dilution data analysis is more reasonable.

The dynamic range of responses plot (figure \ref{fig:globalResultOverview} \textbf{center plot}) depicts the dynamic range which is covered by the data over all sample and antigen combinations used.

\begin{figure}

{\centering \includegraphics[width=14.56in]{figures/global_result_overview1}

\caption{xMAPr anaylsis output data inspection >> global overview (interactive hover feature)}\label{fig:globalResultOverview1}

\href{figures/global_result_overview1.png}{inspect xMAPr anaylsis output data inspection \textgreater\textgreater{} global overview (interactive hover feature)}

The fit type histogram ((figure \ref{fig:globalResultOverview} \textbf{right plot}) displays the used fit histogram in correlation to the calculated response. In the example screenshot it apparent that the \emph{nls\_with\_exclusion} is primarily being used in the high response range. This makes sense since a high sample antibody titer against one antigen is resulting in a very high load of the sample antibodies on the individual bead. Thus a signal drop in the very first dilutions (low sample dilution) are more likely to happen.

The \texttt{dilution\ wise\ dynamic\ range\ plots} (figure \ref{fig:dynamicRangeDilutionWise}) tab depicts intensity ranked order of sample/antigen combinations (x-axis) versus log. MFI (median fluorescence intensity) (y-axis). The plot is being used for visually estimating the saturation effect (upper and lower LOD) in each dilution used.

It is important to evaluate the data quality (figure \ref{fig:beadCountCVhist}; \texttt{quality\ measures\ \textgreater{}\ general\ overview}). Therefore basic measures like the bead count or coefficient of variation between technical replicates are very informative in terms of quality.
A bead count below \textbf{35 beads} results by default (factory suggestion) in a missing value since the MFI (Median fluorescence intensity) is unsure using only 35 beads or below.
The CV cut-off can be set in the pipeline settings (figure \ref{fig:xMAPrPipeline})

\begin{figure}
\includegraphics[width=50.47in]{figures/quality_measures__general_overview} \caption{xMAPr quality measures: bead count and CV histograms}\label{fig:beadCountCVhist}
\end{figure}

\href{figures/quality_measures__general_overview.png}{inspect xMAPr quality measures: bead count and CV histograms}

Since a EDC-NHS coupling of the carboxylated beads with the desired antigens is being used the coupling efficiency might be varying due to the differences in amino acid composition and length of the antigens.
The coupling control plot (figure \ref{fig:MFIcouplingControl}) displays in a ranked fasion the coupling efficiency measured with a detection antibody directed against the recombinant tag the antigens. The interactive hover feature returns the absolute value measured for each antigen.

The MFI of the coupling control (\texttt{quality\ measures\ \textgreater{}\ coupling\ control}) represents the loading of the beads with the individual antigens, which can be different but should not be very low to keep a certain dynamic range for the detection of the antibody titer.

\begin{figure}

The noise MFI (figure \ref{fig:LOD}) (\texttt{quality\ measures\ \textgreater{}\ noise\ MFI}) depicts the ranked ordered mean BLANK values + 3 x SD of the BLANK values, which is being used to estimate the LOD (limit of detection) for each antigen. Again the interactive hover feature show details for each entigen.

\end{figure}

\href{figures/quality_measures__LOD.png}{inspect xMAPr quality measures: LOD\ldots limit of detection}

The stacked barplots (figure \ref{fig:BarplotsValueFiltering}) (\texttt{quality\ measures\ \textgreater{}\ bead-count\ and\ LOD\ filtering}) are displaying the filtering for low bead count, for CV filtering with the used cut-off and showing how many fits failed or get rejected.

\end{figure}

The implemented signal drop detection alg. uses the maximum value of the measured data points and inspect the data points with a lower dilution begining from the maximal MFI data point (\texttt{quality\ measures\ \textgreater{}\ dilution-wise\ signal\ drop\ filtering}). For example signal drops in the first dilution step of the serial dilution range is normal. But also having a huge amount of signal drops in later dilutions is the result of using a low concentration of the detection antibody or the dilution steps were not well choosen.

\begin{figure}
\includegraphics[width=50.5in]{figures/quality_measures__value_filtering_signal_drop} \caption{xMAPr quality measures: stacked barplots of dilution-wise signal drop detection (interactive hover)}\label{fig:BarplotsValueFiltering2}

\href{figures/quality_measures__value_filtering_signal_drop.png}{``xMAPr quality measures: stacked barplots of dilution-wise signal drop detection}

The interative hover feature (figure \ref{fig:BarplotsValueFiltering1}) displays information like which antigen, the count of filtered values and what is the percentage of filtered values form the data matrix. Making it easy to identify problematic antigen or sample candidates.

The missing value heatmap (figure \ref{fig:heatmapNA}) (\texttt{quality\ measures\ \textgreater{}\ heatmap\ of\ NA\ values}) depicts in a compact format where and how many values are missing the the dataset after the response calculation was performed.

The bead count heatmap (figure \ref{fig:heatmapBeadCount}) (\texttt{quality\ measures\ \textgreater{}\ bead\ count\ heatmap}) is designed for quickly identifying problematic antigens or patient samples over the dilution series, which also often resulting in a low bead count.

\hypertarget{global-data-analysis-pca-heatmap}{%

A first look at the data can be performed in the xMAPr app. A PCA (principle component analysis) is automatically generated plotted and colored based on the selected meta data.

The principle component analysis is performed using the factomineR package with missing values removed. The data centering was done by subtracting the column means (omitting NAs) of the data from their corresponding columns. To unify variances scaling of data was done by dividing the (centered) columns of the data by their standard deviations. The 2D PCA (figure \ref{fig:PCA2D}) (\texttt{2D\ PCA}) displays the resulting PCA plot. 1D density plots supporting the interpretaion of the PCA results.

The PCA dimension for the plot can be be selected using the \emph{knobs}. Furthermore advanced plot adjustment like group ellipsis can be set as well using the \emph{``wrench'' button}.

The heatamp (figure \ref{fig:responseHeatmap}) (\texttt{heatmap\ (response\ data)}) displays the clustered heatmap of the calculated response data. If a sample or a antigen possess only NA values it is excluded from the heatmap, which is indicated in the grey text below the \emph{``download heatmap''} button. The heatmap is fully interactive with hover information feature, zoom and screenshot feature. Furthermore the heatmap can be download in its interative form as html using the \emph{``download heatmap''} button. Several parameters can be set like number of clusters of rows and columns or cluster methods to name a few.

The single result view (figure \ref{fig:SingleResults}) (\texttt{inspect\ analysis/response\ table}) enables a inspection of the data down to raw data level by diplaying the results on a antigen/sample combination basis. The upper panel displays the different presentations of the data.

The \textbf{left plot} displays the raw data and the dashed red line indicate the LOD. In addition detected signal drops were marked with a blue cross.

The \textbf{center plot} displays the calulated curve and the curve point, which is being used for the response calculation. The dashed violett vertical line inidcating the lower and upper end of the used dilution steps.

The \textbf{right plot} displays the residuals from the used fit.

\href{figures/inspect_single_results2.png}{inspect xMAPr anaylsis output data inspection \textgreater\textgreater{} single antigen/sample combination fit inspection (log. scale)}

When hitting the e.g.~log. scale buttons the plots were generated using a log. scale on the selected axis (figure \ref{fig:SingleResults2}).

One method to choose the antigen and sample which should plotted are the drop down selection list (figure \ref{fig:SingleResults1}). In the elements the desired selection can also being typed in.

Another method to choose the antigen and sample which should plotted is to use the interactive data table in the lower panel of the inspect analysis/reponse (figure \ref{fig:SingleResults3}.
The desired antigen/sample combination can be directly selected inside the table and when looking for a antigen or sample the search field is very helpful.

In addition if the \texttt{highlight\ select\ antigen/sample\ combination\ in\ global\ plots?} is being switch on the selected antigen/sample combination is being marked in the global plots (figure \ref{fig:SingleResultsMarked1} \& \ref{fig:SingleResultsMarked2}).

\subsubsection{statistical analysis of calculated response data (Screenshots)}\label{statistical-analysis-of-calculated-response-data-screenshots}}

The statistical data analysis is based on samples groups defined by the selected meta data.
A wilcox rank sum test is performed using multiple test correction if the number of groups are more than two.
The test statistics with p-value, adjusted p-value and confidence intervals etc. can be interactively inspected and the data is plotted using a violin plot with a bars indicating significant changes.
